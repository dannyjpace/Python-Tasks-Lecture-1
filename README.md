Python Exercises - Syntax, Variables, Lists, Dictionaries, Control Flow, Functions, and More
  Task Overview
    This Jupyter Notebook contains a set of 17 python exercises including the following concepts: syntax, variables, control flow, functions, and data structures.
    These exercises are split into various sections, each addressing specific aspects of Python programming. 
    Below is a guide, outlining each of the question - the task and concept it refers to. The notebook is referenced by exercise number in corrilation with the following:

Exercise 1: Print a Greeting
  Task: Write a Python program that prints a greeting message, such as "Hello, Python!".
  Concept: Basic use of the print function and Python syntax.

Exercise 2: Basic Arithmetic
  Task: Define two variables a and b, then calculate and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
  Concept: Variable definition, arithmetic operators, and output formatting.

Exercise 3: String Manipulation
  Task: Assign your name to a variable and print a message saying "Hello, [name]!".
  Concept: String manipulation and formatting using f-strings.

Exercise 4: Lists
  Task: Create a list of university names, print the entire list, and then print the first and last universities.
  Concept: List creation, indexing, and list manipulation.

Exercise 5: Dictionaries
  Task: Create a dictionary representing a student with keys like name, age, and grade. Print each key-value pair.
  Concept: Working with dictionaries and key-value pairs.

Exercise 6: Tuples
  Task: Define a tuple representing a point in 2D space and print its values, accessing each element by index.
  Concept: Working with immutable data structures like tuples.

Exercise 7: Sets
  Task: Create a set of colors, modify it by adding/removing elements, and merge it with another set.
  Concept: Understanding sets and their unique properties (e.g., no duplicates).

Exercise 8: Conditional Statements
  Task: Write a program that checks if a user-provided number is positive, negative, or zero and prints an appropriate message.
  Concept: Conditional statements (if, elif, else) and user input handling.

Exercise 9: For Loop
  Task: Iterate through a list of numbers and print each number.
  Concept: Basic use of loops to iterate over lists.

Exercise 10: While Loop
  Task: Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring the loop terminates correctly.
  Concept: Using while loops for repetitive tasks.

Exercise 11: Match Statement
  Task: Use the match statement to print different messages based on a grade input by the user.
  Concept: Exploring modern Python features like match for control flow based on patterns.

Exercise 12: Define a Function
  Task: Define a function greet that prints a greeting with a user's name.
  Concept: Function definition and calling with arguments.

Exercise 13: Function with Return Value
  Task: Define a function square that returns the square of a number.
  Concept: Function return values and basic mathematical operations.

Exercise 14: Function with Default Parameters
  Task: Define a function multiply with a default parameter for the second argument.
  Concept: Working with default parameters in functions.

Exercise 15: List Comprehension
  Task: Use list comprehension to create a list of squares from a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
  Concept: List comprehension for concise and efficient list creation.

Exercise 16: Nested Data Structures
  Task: Create a dictionary of student names and their grades, then write a function to print the average grade for each student.
  Concept: Handling nested data structures and calculating averages.

Exercise 17: Simple Calculator
  Task: Write a calculator function that takes two numbers and an operator as input, performs the operation, and returns the result.
  Concept: Combining functions with control flow and user input.
